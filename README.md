New Minecraft Wiki Redirect
===========================

[Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-minecraft-wiki-redirect/)

This extension will redirect the Fandom Minecraft wiki to <https://minecraft.wiki>

It contains no surprises, no data collection, no third party assets, and uses the minimal set of manifest v3 permissions. Unlike userscript-based alternatives, this uses the declarative net requests APIs to redirect the page before an HTTP request to Fandom is sent, so CPU time isn't wasted loading the original page.

### Redirected domains

This extension redirects the following domains:

- `minecraft.fandom.com`
- `minecraft.gamepedia.com`
- `minecraftwiki.net`
